Systems:
	- Systems are singletons whose only instance simply listens to a set of announcements around it, does bookkeeping,
	  and sometimes sends out messages as well.
	  
Factories:
	- Build an object and notify the proper systems
	
Blueprints:
	- Essentially Factories but build method only sends notifications and returns nothing.
	  
TODO before continuing with list:
	- fix message system organization (DONE)
	- make dungeon behave as a system
	
the structure of the design patterns needs to be very clear before continuing, or the whole thing falls apart..

after this, a RenderSystem needs to be made which listens to entity spawns and makes requests after DUNGEON_LOADED
best case scenero, the rendering system is completely detached from the logic, but it might require listening during update polls
after the render system works, continue with the list
